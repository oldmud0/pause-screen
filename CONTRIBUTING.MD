# Contributing

Thank you for your contribution! In order for your suggestion to be accepted, however, please follow these simple guidelines:

 1. Make a suggestion by creating a pull request, not an issue.
 2. Your changes should be only one or two commits. I cannot merge pull requests that contain merge commits.
 3. The format is as follows: `MM:SS Song - Game or Artist` with blank lines at 5-minute intervals.
 
Again, thanks a lot for your help!
