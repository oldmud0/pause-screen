# Pause Screen - Wario World
This repository hosts the list of music included, in order, for possibly [the longest and most complex medley of video game music ever created](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhEAazYMdwM) as presented by GiIvaSunner, the parody account of high-quality video game music ripper SilvaGunner.

The list is a work in progress and mostly a compilation of suggestions scattered about in the YouTube comments, so please don't hesitate to pitch in if a tune sounds familiar to you and it's not on the list.
